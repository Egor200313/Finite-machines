#### Highlighting text matching regular expression

How to run:

Print `./main.py` in the terminal. The following message will appear:

`Enter source filename:` print your text file name

After that enter regex and colors


Mind that `$` means every ascii symbol and `1` is an empty word

Example:

```
Enter regex in reverse polish form and color
th.$*. green
ab.$*. red

```

To end input send empty line
